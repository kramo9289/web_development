			As soon as you grabbed the chair, someone knocked the door down. You immediately put all of your 
			strength into your strike </br>with the chair. The stranger falls to the floor, letting out a yell of
			pain. You look at the weird face he has. You are stunned at </br>how non-human it is so you back away
			and head towards the door. But as soon as you do, you feel that the creature has grabbed onto your
			foot and pulled you to the ground as well. You try to fight back.
