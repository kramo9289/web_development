			You take your phone and start dialing 911 just as the stranger heads for 
			your door. Someone answers you. You explain the </br>situation you're in frantically.
			The man responds by telling you that officers have been dispatched. He tells 
			you to hide</br> somewhere like under the bed. You don't know what to do. As your 
			thinking of the situation someone starts knocking on the</br> door. You hear him say,
			"Come out, I just want to play." You don't know what to do.
			<div style = "color:#F00000"> 
				<p><a href= "page13.html">Decision 1</a>
				Listen to the operator and hide under the bed
				</p>
				<p><a href= "page7.html">Decision 2</a>
				The operator doesn't know what he is talking about, you grab your baseball bat.
