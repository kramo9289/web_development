			You hide under the bed just like the 911 operator said. You hold your breath as
			and try to stay hidden. The intruder used his knife to "pick" the lock. He slowly
			opens the door and walks into the room. He sees that you called someone because 
			you left the phone on floor. He picks it up and hears the operator say, "Hello, 
			hello, where are you?" He hangs up the phone and looks around. He sees the closet
			door and opens it. He looks through all the clothes. When he finds nothing, he
			turns around and looks at the bed. Just as he heads for it police sirens begin 
			to sound around the neighborhood. He heads for the window and sees that police 
			cars are lined up in the streets. He talks to himself, "I can't get caught, 
			there are still things need to be done." You hear footsteps and then complete 
			silence. Then a sound of relief, "Police, show yourself." You emerge from under
			the bed, barley believing what had happened.  The police search for him but can't
			find anything, but you notice something on your shelf, a note. You open it.
