			You get out of bed and start heading towards your closet.
			You open the door and quickly get in. You start moving </br>
			around until you have completely covered yourself in your 
			clothes. You start to hear the door knob turn. It stops 
			and you </br>hear someone say, "Come I just want to play" while
			he knock on the door. You are freaked by the sound of the
			voice.</br> You look around the closet to see if you find 
			anything useful. You see your old multi function pocket 
			knife on the top shelf </br>and a coat hanger next to you just 
			as the stranger kicks open the door.
			<div style = "color:#D6E3DB"> 
				<p><a href= "page9.html">Decision 1</a>
				You stay in the closet, hoping you are perfectly hidden
				</p>
				<p><a href= "page10.html">Decision 2</a>
				You grab the pocket knife, clutch it in your hand and wait for the perfect moment to strike
				</p>
				<p><a href= "page11.html">Decision 3</a>
				You take the coat hanger and aim the hook towards the closet door, ready to attack
				anything that comes in
				</p>
