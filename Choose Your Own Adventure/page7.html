			You grab the baseball bat and hold it steady in your hands, aiming straight at the door,
			waiting whatever comes through the </br> door. You hear the footsteps getting closer, and closer,
			until you can hear them just outside your door. You see that the door</br> knob is twisting 
			and you are prepared. It suddenly stops. You wonder what happened. It's quiet, and then
			out of nowhere you </br>see a knife jab straight through the wooden door. You are stunned and
			startled, but keep your position. Then the stranger</br> knocks through the door.  You can't
			believe the face he had. There are no words to describe it except non-human. The demon </br>
			spawn heads for you. You make you decision.
			<div style = "color:#FFFFC3"> 
				<p><a href= "page14.html">Decision 1</a>
				You aim at his face; you think it will knock him out so you can escape
				</p>
				<p><a href= "page15.html">Decision 2</a>
				Aim at his body, you believe that it will do more damage and there is a less possibility of him dodging it.
