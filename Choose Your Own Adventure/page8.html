			You put the chair in a position so that it prevents anyone from coming in. 
			You hear the footsteps outside your room. It </br>gets quiet for a while. All of 
			a sudden the intruder starts to tackle the door.  After a few tackles you 
			think that the stranger </br>won't get in. Then you hear him laugh a laugh that
			expresses pure EVIL. He finds your attempt humorous. Then the</br> intruder tackles 
			through the door. You are stunned at his strength. It's not human. He runs for
			you with his knife. It all</br> over, there is nothing you can do.
