			You decided that the best option you have is to stay perfectly still.
			You think that the clothes will cover you and that the intruder</br> will 
			just move onto another room. It will be your perfect time to escape. 
			The sound of the door breaking down startles you. You stay </br>still, 
			holding your breathe so that you make no sound. You see that he is 
			looking throughout the room, desperately looking for you. </br>Then, a 
			smile appears on his face as he turns to the closet. He stares at 
			you with those evil eyes. He knows where you are, you are </br>too stunned
			at the face to react. He rushes to the closet with his knife. He stabs 
			it directly at the pile of clothes you were hidden in.
