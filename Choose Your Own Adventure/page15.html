			You chose the body; As soon as he gets close enough you hit him. It's a 
			good hit. He falls to the floor in pain. He can't get up. You</br> run down your
			stairs. By morning police investigated the whole incident. When police had 
			first arrived they found him on the</br> floor. You find out that his name was 
			Jeff. He had been responsible for all the murders you've been hearing about
			on the tv. It took </br>a whole squad of police men to take him away. The officer
			tells you that you should be proud that you managed to catch a criminal</br> that 
			they were looking for. As the police car leaves with Jeff in it, he looks out
			the window and smiles at you. He does this until</br> you can no longer see the car.
			A chill runs through your spine. But you're glad he is locked up and that he 
			will never be able to</br> escape. Right?
