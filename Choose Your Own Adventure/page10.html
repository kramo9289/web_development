			You clutch the pocket knife in your hand. You see a weird being with a white face 
			and creepy scars on his face. You position the knife </br>so that you are ready to strike
			at him. He screams, "WHERE ARE YOU, I JUST WANT TO PLAY WITH YOU." Then his head turns</br> 
			to the closet, he smiles with his mouth open. He walks slowly towards the closet.
			As soon as he gets close enough you open the door</br> and immediately stab him. He yells
			a painful sound, he is hurt. You head for the door and run down the staircase. You 
			run out to your </br>front porch and start running, you don't know where but you are glad 
			you escaped. You eventually get to a police station and run in.</br> You talk frantically
			to the officer about what you had experience. After receiving all the details about 
			his face, he tells you who it was.</br> It was him. The one responsible for all the deaths 
			you've seen on the tv. It was Jeff. The following day your house is surrounded by </br>
			policemen. As it turns out, Jeff had escaped and left a note just for you.
