			You remember they are out on their anniversary. After your 
			fifth attempt you realize they are not going to answer </br>the
			phone.  Suddenly you hear footsteps going up the staircase 
			outside your room. You think of what you're going to do</br> next.
			You realize you can call the police and you quickly grab your 
			phone. As you are reaching for your phone you see your</br>
			baseball bat next to your chair.
			<div style = "color:#E00000"> 
				<p><a href= "page6.html">Decision 1</a>
				You call 911
				</p>
				<p><a href= "page7.html">Decision 2</a>
				You grab your baseball bat and wait at the door until the starnger gets near
				</p>
				<p><a href= "page8.html">Decision 3</a>
				You grab the chair and put it against the door, thinking it can prevent anyone from coming in
				</p>
