			You are about to go to sleep. You turn off the lamp beside you and start</br>
			to close your eyes. Suddenly there is a loud crash in your living room.</br>
			You shake it off and try to go to sleep again. Then again, a loud sound</br>
			emanates from the house. This time, you hear it's getting closer.</br>
			<div style = "color:#C5E2DC"> 
				<p><a href= "page2.html">Decision 1</a>
				Shake it off again. It's probably just your imagination
				</p>
				<p><a href= "page3.html">Decision 2</a>
				You get out of bed and start dialing your parents
				</p>
				<p><a href= "page4.html">Decision 3</a>
				You head for your closet and hide
