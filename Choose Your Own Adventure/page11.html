			You are ready with the hook pointing at the door. You're ready to 
			jab anything that comes through that door. The intruder looks </br>throughout 
			the room and notices that closet door is slightly opened. You see him 
			smile as he heads towards you. You squeeze the </br>hanger in your hand. He
			opens the door quickly and screams, "I'LL PUT YOU TO SLEEP." As he yells
			this you jab the coat </br>hanger at his face. The wooden part breaks and he 
			falls, but not to the ground. He quickly gets up and laughs at your attempt. 
			"I'LL </br>MAKE SURE YOU GO TO SLEEP SLOWLY." He puts his knife away and picks 
			up the metal part of the hanger. You shake in</br> fear, unable to move.
